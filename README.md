# Sticky-Notes
CTO Challenge #24 

This was a first for me in terms of using image recognition packages. In the end, it was pretty simple to get the project up and running, and most of the time spent was fumbling around in documentation and Stack Overflow pages until I was able to piece together the relevant information

PYTesseract was very impressive at recognizing the words, as was the openCV library for image segmentation. In the future, I might revisit this in order to fix up how sticky notes are seen.

Lots of fun!
